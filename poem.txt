Middle-Age Enthusiasms

    By Thomas Hardy



To M. H.



    We passed where flag and flower
    Signalled a jocund throng;
    We said: "Go to, the hour
    Is apt!" and joined the song;
    And, kindling, laughed at life and care,
    Although we knew no laugh lay there.

    We walked where shy birds stood
    Watching us, wonder-dumb;
    Their friendship met our mood;
    We cried: "We'll often come:
    We'll come morn, noon, eve, everywhen!"
    - We doubted we should come again.

    We joyed to see strange sheens
    Leap from quaint leaves in shade;
    A secret light of greens
    They'd for their pleasure made.
    We said: "We'll set such sorts as these!"
    - We knew with night the wish would cease.

    "So sweet the place," we said,
    "Its tacit tales so dear,
    Our thoughts, when breath has sped,
    Will meet and mingle here!" . . .
    "Words!" mused we. "Passed the mortal door,
    Our thoughts will reach this nook no more."
